	<h1>About</h1>
	<p> I am currently based in Durham, NC, and I graduated as a first generation college student with my B.A. in 2016. My first programming course was during my senior year of college, and while I enjoyed it I never knew what to do with what I had learned! I have spent the last few years working in nonprofit education, and now I am pursuing a career switch to web development. <br>
In my free time I like experimenting with new vegan foods, going to concerts, and spending time with my two cats, Ziggy and Cirrus. </p>
